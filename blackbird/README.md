# blackbird — a static-asset qube (chess in the browser)

A full chess game you play in the browser — board, rules, and engine — shipped
as **static files**. The engine is a **high-performance Rust chess engine
compiled to WebAssembly** (magic bitboards, transposition table, quiescence
search) that runs **entirely in the browser, at near-native speed** — the search
happens on your device, off the main thread in a Web Worker, with **no server**.
There is no q64 source to compile and no backend; the whole qube is the `web/`
folder, served as-is. It's the example for bringing a hand-written web app
(HTML/CSS/JS + whatever wasm it loads) to qubepods **unchanged**.

## What it shows

- **A static-site qube.** `qube.json5` declares `static: { dir: "web" }` and
  nothing else — no `entry`, no `component`. `qube deploy` zips `web/` and serves
  it at the edge. The page's own `index.html` is the page.
- **An asset wasm, not a q64 build.** The Blackbird engine
  (`web/engine/blackbird.wasm`) is **Rust compiled to `wasm32`** — just a file the
  page fetches in a Web Worker, one static asset among the images and scripts,
  **not** the pod's component. A static qube has no wasm to run; the browser runs
  this one.
- **No compile step.** Everything needed to play is committed (engine ~130 KB +
  the board UI), so a plain checkout runs, and a deploy ships the same bytes.

## Run it locally

The page fetches wasm, so it needs an HTTP server (not `file://`):

```sh
python3 -m http.server -d web 8080
# open http://localhost:8080
```

You play white; the engine answers automatically. **Engine move** plays for
whichever side is to move, so you can take black or watch it play itself.

## Deploy it

Open your project in **Qubonaut** (`app.qubepods.com`), clone this repo in its
terminal, and from this folder:

```sh
qube deploy
```

That ships `web/` as the project's static site and prints the live URL. No
Backend switch, no build — it's files.

## Layout

```
blackbird/
├── qube.json5     # static-site manifest — `static: { dir: "web" }`
└── web/           # the whole deploy: served as-is
    ├── index.html # the page
    ├── app.js     # board UI: render + clicks
    ├── worker.js  # runs the engine off the main thread
    ├── style.css
    ├── engine/
    │   └── blackbird.wasm   # the chess engine — an ASSET the page loads
    └── img/       # piece sprites
```

## How it works

`index.html` / `app.js` render the board and capture clicks; they hand moves to
`worker.js`, which runs `engine/blackbird.wasm` and answers with the engine's
move. The engine is the single source of truth for the rules — after every move
it reports the full state (legal moves, check/mate), so the UI never
re-implements chess. All of that is plain browser code; qubepods just serves the
files.

## Interoperability — a Rust engine on a wasm-native platform

qubepods is a **WebAssembly** platform, and a qube is *wasm + a manifest*. So the
source language doesn't matter: this **Rust** engine builds, previews
(`qube run`), and ships (`qube deploy`) through the **same `qube` tooling** as a
[q64](https://q64.dev) qube — no q64 code anywhere in it. q64 is the platform's
native language, but it is not a requirement; bring any wasm and qubepods serves
it the same way.

This example is the **client-side** rung of that interoperability: the Rust wasm
is a static asset the browser runs, with no server component. Worth making
explicit, because it surprises people — **a serious, native-grade engine runs
right in the browser.** The same Rust that would compile to a desktop binary
compiles to WebAssembly and searches at near-native speed on the user's device;
qubepods just hands the file to the page. No game server, no API round-trip, no
GPU — the engine *is* the page. The **deeper** rung
is composition — the same Rust engine can compile to a **WIT component** (the
[WebAssembly Component Model](https://component-model.bytecodealliance.org/)) that
a q64 qube *calls* over wRPC or links with `wac`, with q64 as the orchestrator and
the Rust engine as a linked capability. (The component world
`qubepods:blackbird/blackbird` — `best-move` / `legal-moves` / `apply-move` —
lives in the engine's own repo.) Same engine, same platform, two integration
depths: ship a wasm as-is, or wire it into the q64 world as a typed component.
