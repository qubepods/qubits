# backend-counter

The **backend starter** for qubepods: one page, one button, one number —
shared by everyone.

Every click bumps a counter that lives in the project's backend, so the
number is the same for every visitor. Open the page on your phone and your
laptop at once: click on one, watch it move on the other.

It's about 100 lines of [q64](https://q64.dev) in
[`src/main.q`](./src/main.q) — a single `wasi:http` handler that serves its
own page *and* keeps the count. No framework, no build step, no separate
backend service to wire up.

```
GET  /            → the HTML page (button + live count)
GET  /api/count   → the current count, as plain text
POST /api/click   → add one atomically, return the new count
```

## What this teaches

1. **Turning on a backend for a project** — the one switch that gives a
   project persistent, shared state.
2. **A qube that paints its own UI and keeps its own state** — frontend and
   backend are the same artifact.
3. **The WASI connection** — how the qube's `env.kv` capability is wired to
   the project's Durable Object so the count survives and is shared.

## 1. Create a project with the backend enabled

In the qubepods app, create a new project. On the create form there's a
**Backend** switch:

> **Backend** — provision a database, storage & key-value plus a live
> frontend↔backend connection.

Turn it **on**. This is chosen once at creation and can't be flipped later —
a project either has a backend twin or it doesn't, because turning one on
later would be a data migration, not a toggle.

A backend-enabled project is anchored by a single **Durable Object**. That's
the whole trick behind "everyone shares this count": there is exactly one
backend instance per project, its storage is SQLite, and every request to the
project's endpoint lands on it.

Without a backend, a project is static/stateless — fine for a brochure site,
but two visitors would never see a shared number.

## 2. Run it — in the browser (no desktop needed)

You don't need a terminal, a toolchain, or even a laptop. qubepods is
browser-first: a mobile or iPad is enough. The IDE — **Qubonaut** — runs at
`app.qubepods.com` as an installable PWA, and you're **already signed in**
there, so there's no login step and no token to save.

1. Open your backend-enabled project from step 1 and tap **Edit** to open it
   in Qubonaut, with this example's source loaded.
2. Press **Run**.

That's it. Pressing **Run** builds the qube to WebAssembly on-device (the q64
compiler itself is wasm, so it works on iPad Safari) and deploys it onto the
project. No `qube build`, no `qube pod login`, no `qube pod deploy` — those are
the desktop-CLI spellings of what the **Run** button does for you.

Your project already has its address on **`*.qubepod.app`**, shown on the
project page.

> **Public access is the part we're still building.** Pressing **Run** builds
> and deploys the qube and gives you a live preview of the page. Wiring the
> project's `*.qubepod.app` route so *anyone* on the open internet hits your
> Durable Object — that last hop is in active development, and **this example
> is the one we're using to get there.** When it lands, the steps above don't
> change: same Run button, same route, now public.

### Prefer a desktop terminal?

Everything above also has a CLI form, for when you're working from a laptop
instead of the dashboard. Clone the repo and build/run it against any WASIp3
host:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/qubepods/qubepods-examples.git
cd qubepods-examples/backend-counter
qube build --component
wasmtime serve target/<host>/backend-counter.component.wasm   # open http://localhost:8080
```

Run this way the count lives in the host's own store for the life of the
process — just you, and it resets when you stop the server. Deploying to a
project from the CLI (`qube pod login` then `qube pod deploy`) is the desktop
counterpart to the **Run** button, and rides the same in-progress public-route
work noted above.

## 3. How the shared count works

The handler is the entire app:

```q64
@http_handler
pub fn handle(req: Request) -> Response @kv {
    match (req.method(), req.path()) {
        ("GET",  "/")          -> Response.html(page())
        ("GET",  "/api/count") -> Response.ok("{bump(0)}")
        ("POST", "/api/click") -> Response.ok("{bump(1)}")
        _                      -> Response.not_found()
    }
}

fn bump(delta: i64) -> i64 @kv {
    match env.kv.increment(COUNTER_KEY, delta) {
        Ok(n)  -> n
        Err(_) -> 0
    }
}
```

- The count is a single key in the project's key-value store, reached through
  the `env.kv` capability.
- `env.kv.increment(key, delta)` is **atomic**. Two people clicking at the
  same moment both get counted — the host applies both bumps without losing
  one. Reading the current value is just a bump of `0`.
- The page (served by `GET /`) is plain HTML + a few lines of JavaScript: on
  load it fetches `/api/count`, the button `POST`s to `/api/click`, and it
  polls every ~1.5s so clicks from *other* people show up on your screen too.

Because there's one Durable Object per project and one count inside it, every
browser pointed at the endpoint is reading and writing the same number.

## 4. The WASI connection

This is the part the example is really here to show.

The qube never names "Durable Object," "SQLite," or "Cloudflare" anywhere. It
only declares a capability:

```json5
// qube.json5
effects: { declared: ["@kv"] }
```

`@kv` makes the compiler emit a `wasi:keyvalue` import into the component, and
nothing else. You can see the qube's full, honest capability surface with:

```sh
qube audit
# backend-counter wants: wasi:keyvalue   (no network, no filesystem)
```

When qubepods boots the component, the host **binds that `wasi:keyvalue`
import to this project's Durable Object**. The qube calls `env.kv.increment`;
the host turns that into an atomic write against the DO's SQLite-backed
store. The qube is portable — the same bytes run under `wasmtime serve` on
your laptop — and the host decides what `env.kv` actually *is*. The capability
is the contract; the binding is the connection.

That import-to-Durable-Object binding is the WASI connection the platform is
building out, and this example is its smallest end-to-end exercise: a qube
that asks for `wasi:keyvalue` and a project whose Durable Object answers.

### Why you write this in public

This is an open repo. You're meant to pull it, read it, and run it — and that
is exactly the point of declaring capabilities the way q64 does.

The `@kv` line isn't a promise you have to take on faith. It's a fact you can
check. Because both the source and the manifest are public, anyone — a
teammate, a stranger, or an AI agent about to compose this qube into something
larger — can read `qube.json5`, run `qube audit`, and see the whole truth:
this thing wants a key-value store and *nothing else*. No network to ship the
count somewhere, no filesystem, no surprise calls. If it tried to reach the
network, the manifest would have to say `@network`, and `qube audit` would show
it — before anyone ran a line.

That's the opposite of "trust our sandbox." The wasm artifact **is** the
boundary, and the boundary is in the open: you trust the code because you can
see its declared shape, not because something promises to contain it. Shipping
examples in public isn't a marketing nicety here — public, auditable
capabilities are the security model. A counter is a small thing to audit; the
habit is the point.

## Status & what's evolving

This example is deliberately at the leading edge — it's both a demo and a
spec for the pieces being finished. As of now:

- **Working:** the q64 source (one `@http_handler`, `env.kv`) and component
  emission to `wasi:http/proxy`; building it **on-device in the browser** (the
  q64 compiler is itself wasm, iPad included) and serving it under a WASIp3
  host. The backend-enabled project + single Durable Object + SQLite storage
  exist, and the project's `*.qubepod.app` route is shown on the project page.
- **Being wired:** the **Run → public** last hop — deploying from the browser
  and serving the project's `*.qubepod.app` route to the open internet so every
  visitor hits the same Durable Object; and binding the component's
  `wasi:keyvalue` import to *that* project's DO at boot (per-project,
  per-identity). Until those land, **Run** builds, deploys, and previews for
  you, and `env.kv` resolves to the host's default store. **This example is the
  thing we're using to finish that hop.**
- **On the roadmap:** a raw-SQL face (`env.db` → `wasi:sql`) over the same
  Durable Object, for examples that want tables and queries rather than a
  single counter; and richer `wasi:http` `Request`/`Response` builders
  (`req.method()`, `req.path()`, `Response.html`) firming up as standard
  surface.

If you're reading the q64 source and a constructor looks slightly ahead of
what your toolchain ships, that's expected — this folder is one of the things
driving those surfaces to completion.
