# qubits

Example [Qubes](https://qubepods.com) you can read, pull, and deploy.

Each folder is a self-contained [q64](https://q64.dev) Qube with its own
README. They start small and stay honest: every example is real source you
can build with `qube` and deploy to a qubepods project.

## Examples

| Example | What it shows |
|---------|---------------|
| [**adder**](./adder/) | The **smallest q64 component** — a library qube whose whole surface is one scalar function, `add(a, b) = a + b`. `qube build --component` emits the core module plus a WebAssembly component and its synthesized WIT world (`export add: func(a: s64, b: s64) -> s64`, no imports — the pure canonical-ABI scalar lift). The hello-world of the q64 component path. |
| [**clock**](./clock/) | The **capability twin of adder** — a one-function library qube, `now_ns()`, wrapping `env.time.monotonic_ns()`. Same shape, but its world is not empty: calling the `env.time` face derives an `import wasi:clocks/monotonic-clock` — capabilities are inferred from code, never declared. The bare-scalar face: no Result box, no memory, `@realtime`-safe. |
| [**now**](./now/) | **The smallest runnable clock** — the application that makes [`clock`](./clock/) *show something*. `main()` links the `clock` library and prints its reading, so `qube run` writes `monotonic time: <N> ns` to the terminal. Where `clock` is a library (nothing to run on its own), `now` is the runnable sibling: the "add a `main` that uses the library" shape, the minimal `env.time` + `env.out` program. |
| [**stopwatch**](./stopwatch/) | **Two qubes bound into one Qube.** An application whose `main()` links `adder` + `clock` via the manifest's `dependencies` block (keys = qube names = module paths), times the `add()` call between two clock readings, and prints the elapsed nanoseconds. Shows source-level linking (the dep qubes become plain functions in one core module), the **capability closure** (stdout + monotonic-clock in the world, adder contributes nothing), and the preview1→`wasi:cli/run` command lift that makes a printing Qube runnable on any component host. |
| [**open-sesame**](./open-sesame/) | **Variables & secrets, end to end.** A one-file door-keeper API that greets with the project variable `GREETING` and opens only for the project secret `SESAME_PASSWORD` — neither value in the repo. The manifest **declares** them (`imports.variables` / `imports.secrets`), which buys deploy-time validation (deploy fails naming any unset value) and least privilege (only declared names are injected, as `env.<NAME>`). Live at [open-sesame.qubepod.app](https://open-sesame.qubepod.app/). |
| [**api-classic**](./api-classic/) | The **API backend** starter. A classic request/response HTTP API worker — a plain `export default { fetch }` module (**no wasm on the server**) that uses the project's **key-value store, SQLite database, and object storage** through `env.KV` / `env.DB` / `env.BUCKET`. Capability-bounded: it declares an `env` block in the manifest and **never names a namespace, database, or bucket** — the host opens each store and pins it to the qube's identity. One manifest, `qube run` / `qube deploy`, no wrangler. The request/response sibling of `twin-counter`. |
| [**htmx-booking**](./htmx-booking/) | The **hypermedia frontend** starter — a slot-booking app where the worker renders **HTML fragments** and [htmx](https://htmx.org) swaps them in. No build step, no frontend framework, no client-side state: the date picker is the browser's native `<input type="date">`, bookings live in SQLite via `env.DB`, and one pinned `<script>` is the page's only JS. Shows attribute-driven requests, out-of-band swaps, `HX-Trigger` server events, and a **polling server clock** (`hx-trigger="every 1s"`) that reports the edge colo rendering it (via the gate's `x-qube-cf-*` headers — a WfP user worker can't read `request.cf`) — the request/response cousin of `twin-counter`'s server-rendered diffs. Live at [electric-moss-27.qubepod.app](https://electric-moss-27.qubepod.app/). |
| [**twin-counter**](./twin-counter/) | The backend starter. A button and a shared count, built as a **twin** — a frontend wasm that renders, and a backend wasm you write that holds the count in a WASI key-value store (`env.kv`) and serves it over wRPC. |
| [**scene-overlay**](./scene-overlay/) | A QView form floating over a **3D scene** (`scene` viewport, kind 21): a turning cube drawn by the quine engine behind a frosted card with a live counter. No backend — local `state` and an `on_5` press handler. Also **links a second qube** (`color/`) for the swatch colour. The base for QView-widgets-over-3D. |
| [**qube-rocks**](./qube-rocks/) | **Asteroids-lite** — a **static-asset qube** (like blackbird) whose page loads the shared **quine** 3D engine from the CDN and runs the whole game client-side. Single player, no backend, no server. The game loop is a deterministic skill (`onPreStep` at **64 Hz**): steer with `transform.rotation`, fire + split rocks with `world.spawn`/`despawn`, driven by the **reusable on-screen controller** overlay (`controls.js`) the `water`/`sundial`/`terrain` examples share. Shows the engine's fixed-timestep + render interpolation, runtime spawn/despawn, and the `cone` ship mesh. |
| [**blackbird**](./blackbird/) | A full chess game you play in the browser, shipped as a **static-asset qube**: `qube.json5` declares `static: { dir: "web" }` and `qube deploy` serves the `web/` folder as-is — no q64 compile, no component, no backend. The engine is a **high-performance Rust chess engine compiled to WebAssembly** (~1500 Elo) that runs **in the browser at near-native speed** (no server), loaded by the page as an *asset* wasm — deployed through the same `qube` tooling as a q64 qube. Shows qubepods is **wasm-native and language-agnostic**: bring any wasm, ship it unchanged. |

## Using an example

Each example is a normal qube. Open your project in **Qubonaut**
(`app.qubepods.com`), clone this repo in its terminal, and from the example's
folder:

```sh
qube run
```

See the example's own README for what it does and which kind of project it
needs (some need a project with the **Backend** switch turned on).
